# Contributing

To ensure the long term viability of the project, we ask that you
complete a few requirements before contributing:

1. Notarize and send an [affidavit](./identity_affidavit.pdf) that
   affirms your email address and PGP key, as well as a proof of
   address. You may use [notarize.com](http://www.notarize.com/) or a
   physical notary near you. Contact rian@alum.mit.edu for the
   receiving address.  This step associates your email and PGP key
   with your legal identity. Note that we only use your address as a
   way to disambiguate you from other people who may share your name,
   it is not used for any other purpose.

2. Edit the [AUTHORS](./AUTHORS) file and add your name, email address
   and PGP long key ID. Sign the commit with the PGP key (or a sub
   key) from step 1. This step licenses your contributions under the
   MIT license.

3. Sign all of your commits with the PGP key (or a sub key) from
   step 1.  This step ties your contribution back to your license.

Once these requirments are completed, we are able to accept your pull
requests.

These requirements aren't strictly necessary to submit a patch or pull
request. However, if these steps are not performed, your patch will be
used for reference only - it will not be applied to the code.
